The MASH pipeline for WGBS is split into 2 parts due to computational limitations. 

Part 1 extracts the betas and se of betas from the matrix eqtl results for all snp-gene pairs,
the correlation structure using the null tests is estimated, and fits mash to the random tests.

Part 2 computes posterior summaries for the strong tests using the previous mash fit and saves the results.
